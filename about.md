# Research

### Bachelors Thesis - Spring 2014  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [*SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden*](https://www.scilifelab.se)

An investigation into differentially expressed protein isoforms and their subcellular localization in three human cell lines used in the Human Protein Atlas.  
*Computational analysis of transcriptomic data from the Human Protein Atlas to evaluate how expression of transcript isoforms affects the subcellular localization of the corresponding protein isoforms*
